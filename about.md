Before that, he was a Visiting Researcher in the Department of Astrophysics and Cosmology at S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, till ~~the plague~~ *COVID19* mucked it all up. In pre-covid days, he did his Masters' and Doctorate at the same institute.
​
His PhD ~~dust collector~~ Thesis was on the accretion processes around Black Holes and Neutron Stars. One can find a detailed list of his work, interests and publications somwhere in this *website* or by simply poking him with a stick.
